			<div id = "paragraph"> Hi there! My name is Jacob. I am originally from the Bay Area, but moved to Houston at the young age of 12. I have resided in Texas ever since.  In 2016, I received my B.A. from The University of Texas at Austin. Currently, I am employed as an IC worker for a small beverage company called Gizmo Beverages. There I command the roles of sales representative and brand ambassador, selling and marketing their product, Tea of a Kind. <br> <br> As of late I am learning the jack of all trades skill of becoming a full-stack web developer with UT's Coding Bootcamp. This site was our first big homework assignment. Some of my hobbies include reading, going for runs and composing music!
